# Rank and Partition

The goal of this challenge is to use [Window Functions](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-window-functions/) like `RANK` or `SUM` with the `OVER` keyword.

`OVER` clause can be used with:
- `PARTITION BY` to select the scoped rows
- `ORDER BY` to define the order of the rows in which the window function should be applied

Open the notebook to get started.
